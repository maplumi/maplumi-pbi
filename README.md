Maplumi Power BI Map Visual
=====================

Maplumi is a powerful and flexible mapping visual for Power BI that allows you to visualize geographical data in multiple ways. It combines the capabilities of both proportional circle maps and choropleth maps in a single visual, with rich customization options.

Key Features
-----------

### Dual Layer Visualization
- **Choropleth Maps**: Color-code geographic areas based on data values
- **Proportional Circle Maps**: Display up to two sets of values as scaled circles on the map
- **Layer Control**: Independently enable/disable each layer as needed

### Base Maps
- Multiple base map providers:
  - Mapbox
  - MapTiler
  - OpenStreetMap
- Customizable map styles and attributions

### Interactive Features
- Interactive tooltips showing detailed information
- Click-to-select features for cross-filtering
- Zoom and pan controls
- Automatic map extent fitting to your data

### Styling Options
- Customizable colors for both choropleth and circle layers
- Adjustable circle sizes and stroke widths
- Multiple color ramp options for choropleth maps
- Layer opacity controls
- Border/stroke customization

### Legend
- Customizable legend position (top, bottom, left, right, or center)
- Adjustable legend styling (background, border, opacity)
- Support for both choropleth and circle size legends
- Custom legend titles and formatting

### Data Classification
- Multiple classification methods for choropleth maps
- Adjustable number of classes
- Custom color ramps or predefined color schemes
- Support for various color modes (LAB, RGB, HSL, etc.)

Getting Started
-------------
1. Add your location data (e.g., administrative codes, latitude/longitude)
2. Configure value fields for coloring regions or sizing circles
3. Customize the appearance using the format pane
4. Add tooltips to show additional information on hover

Advanced Features
---------------
- Custom map attributions
- Label decluttering options
- Map extent locking
- Flexible tooltip formatting
- Custom color ramp definitions

Roadmap
-------

- Support for GeoJSON and KML file imports
- Advanced data classification methods (e.g., custom breaks)
- Multi-measure choropleth support

### Performance Optimization
- Vector tile support for faster rendering
- Improved memory management for large datasets
- Progressive loading for big data sets
- WebGL rendering for enhanced performance

### Analysis Tools
- Distance and area measurement tools
- Basic spatial analysis capabilities
- Isochrone visualization
- Custom coordinate system support
- Data-driven styling rules

### Additional Base Maps
